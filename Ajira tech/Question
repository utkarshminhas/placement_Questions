SpaceKings
Asha and Amar are playing SpaceKings a video game. It is a two player game where the second player is the helper. Asha needs your help maximizing her gold while playing her favorite game. Both are facing N aliens. Asha and Amar are both at a single location and the aliens are in lined up in front of them. Asha and Amar take turns shooting the aliens, and she goes first. During her turn, Asha may choose any alien to shoot at (this means Asha may choose to skip a turn). During his turn, Amar always shoots the alien closest to him to help Asha maximize her gold. Asha and Amar can not shoot dead alien.
If Asha shoots at an alien, its hit points are reduced by P. If Amar shoots at an alien, its hit points are reduced by Q. If an alien's hit points goes below 1, it is killed. The ith alien starts with Hi hit points. Asha is awarded Gi gold if her shot kills the ith alien, but none if Amar's shot kills it. What is the maximum amount of gold Asha can obtain?

Input 
Each case begins with one line containing three space-separated integers representing P, Q and N. N lines then follow, with the ith line containing two space-separated integers representing Hi and Gi. The aliens are given in the order of their distance from Asha and Amar. In other words, Amar will shoot at the ith alien only if all aliens < i are dead.
